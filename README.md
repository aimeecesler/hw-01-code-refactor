# Homework Assignment 1: HW-01-CODE-REFRACTOR
This repository contains my refactoring of the Horiseon company website. My goal was to not only create a better functioning website but to also ensure that it is compliant with all ADA requirements.

## Refactoring Process
During the refactoring process I made the following changes to the HTML and CSS code:
    - Updated the title for a more descriptive option
    - Changed all div elements to their appropriate corresponding semantic elements for ADA compliance.
        * Header
        * Nav
        * Figure
        * Main
        * Section
        * Aside
        * Footer
    - Added alt text to all images on the pages that accurately described each image for ADA compliance.
    - Corrected the in-page link for the Search Engine Optimization Navigation Button to function.
    - Consolidated CCS selectors and properties where applicable to clean up the CSS document.
    - Reorganized all CSS items to follow the HTML elements semantic structure for ease of reading.
    - Added descriptive comments to all HTML and CSS items for easier editing.
    - Moved the main website image from the CSS page to the HTML page to be consistent with other images.
    - Renamed the image class from "hero" to "figure" for better description of the element.
    - Updated the background color on the aside section for ADA contrast compliance.

## ADA Compliance
This webpage was run through the WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool to ensure compliance (https://wave.webaim.org/). There were no errors detected.
